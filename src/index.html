I'm always eager to learn more, and I crave knowledge. I strive to be happy and enjoy what I'm doing, but I'm always looking for ways to improve myself. I care as much about the aesthetic of a page as the integrity of the code that's used to build it. I'm a problem solver who finds fulfillment in flawless creative execution and a critical thinker whose suggestions and solutions are built on consideration and understanding.">
